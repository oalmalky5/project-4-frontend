# Project 4: Decks Records

Decks Record is an e-commerce web app that sells my collection of records that I gathered throughout the years. Users can resgister and view the products and the prices, while admin will have the ability to add, remove and edit products. 

This was my fourth and final project as part of the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course. The objective was to build a full stack web application using Nodejs/React/MongoDB/Express in two weeks.

## Aproach Taken

This project was open to Individual or group work. I decided to work on it individually to test how much I can accomplish alone in this timeframe. Deicding to choose an e-commerce app was because the features for this kind of project are many and it will give me the ability to work on the project even beyond the course.

during the project, the goal was to finish a first version that comply with the requirements. This was essintial. so users can view the products submitted and linking the product and the user collections.
after this was accomplished, it was the time to think about adding more features and see what can be accomplished in the remaining time 



## Running the App

npm  
```
$ npm install
```

Run server
```
$npm start
```

## Bugs and issues

one of the problem i faced was not working with extra collection for the cart portion. The goal was to finish the main objective with only two collections(user, product).
this led me to me not being able to add the cart functionality so for the meantime users can only view the products wothout bein able to interact with it further

## Deployed App

## Future Additons.


Adding the cart and the checkout functionality.

Using a payment method such as stripe.

adding a filter that filters out products based on thier price(or anything else).

adding a show page for product where the user can view more information about the specific product

making the search feature more responisve(no need to refresh with each search).
